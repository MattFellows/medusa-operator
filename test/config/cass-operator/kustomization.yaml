  # Until cass-operator 1.5 is released, we need to use a more recent image than 1.4.1 in
  # order to get the merge functionality for containers specified in
  # CassandraDatacenter.Spec.PodTemplateSpec. We also need a patch for a bug involving
  # volume mounts. See https://k8ssandra.atlassian.net/browse/K8C-89 for details.
